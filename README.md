AutoML-MLOps Platform
Overview
Our AutoML-MLOps platform is designed to empower users to create, train, and deploy AI-ML models effortlessly, without the need for extensive coding expertise. This user-centric platform includes features like automated data preprocessing, model hyperparameter optimization, real-time performance tracking, and an integrated community for model sharing. Our goal is to simplify and streamline the end-to-end machine learning workflow, allowing users to scale and host models on our cloud infrastructure and access them via an API.

Platform Workflow
The platform is organized into several key modules, each responsible for different stages of the ML lifecycle:

1. User Website
AI-ML Model Creator: The user-facing interface enables users to create models through a guided, no-code interface. Users can choose from a variety of pre-trained models or build their own models from scratch.
Community Access: Users can explore a repository of publicly shared models, connect with other creators, and gain insights from the community. This collaborative environment encourages knowledge sharing and model reuse.
Performance Metrics and Analysis: Users have access to analytics dashboards that provide insights into model performance, including real-time metrics and visualizations, to help them track and optimize their models.
2. Model Creator
Data Pre-Processing: This module automates data cleansing and preprocessing to ensure that the data is ready for model training. It includes options for data classification and transformation.
Model Training and Hyperparameter Optimization: Leveraging H2O.ai and MLflow, the platform automatically tunes model hyperparameters for optimal performance. This process significantly reduces the time and effort needed to create efficient, high-performing models.
MLflow Integration: MLflow tracks model development and versioning, ensuring that all experiments are recorded and reproducible.
3. Tracking and Monitoring
Prometheus & Grafana Integration: For real-time performance tracking, the platform integrates Prometheus and Grafana. This allows users to visualize model metrics, monitor model health, and detect anomalies in real time. It also provides critical insights for model evaluation and continuous improvement.
Performance Dashboards: These dashboards display model metrics, such as accuracy, latency, and resource utilization, in easy-to-interpret charts and graphs.
4. Community Platform
Model Sharing: Users can publish their models to the community platform, making them accessible to others for inspiration or direct use. Public models can be discovered and used by users working on similar projects.
Storage with Hugging Face: Model and data storage is managed with Hugging Face, facilitating seamless access and sharing. Users can also utilize this storage to organize their own data or models securely.
Netlify for Deployment: The community platform is hosted on Netlify, ensuring fast, scalable, and reliable web hosting.
5. Automation
Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD): The platform includes GoCD to automate the pipeline for building, testing, and updating models. This ensures that models stay up-to-date with minimal manual intervention, saving time and enhancing productivity.
Model API Generation: Once a model is trained, it can be hosted on our platform or elsewhere via a generated API. This provides users with flexibility and control over how they deploy and use their models.
6. AI-Assisted Model Building
LangChain and ONMeta: To further assist users in building models, the platform integrates an AI helper that provides documentation and guidance. Users can interact with this AI to streamline the model creation process.
LLM for Documentation: A large language model (LLM) assists users with model creation and usage, providing them with detailed documentation and troubleshooting tips.
Unique Features
No-Code Model Creation: Our platform allows users to build machine learning models without any coding expertise, using simple English prompts as guidance.
Community-Driven Model Sharing: Public and private model-sharing options promote a collaborative environment where users can benefit from each other’s work.
Auto Hyperparameter Tuning: Automated hyperparameter tuning ensures that models are optimized for the user’s specific data and objectives.
Scalable Model Deployment: Models are auto-scaled based on demand, optimizing performance and cost for users.
Real-Time Monitoring and Analytics: Comprehensive monitoring and analytics provide insights into model performance and resource usage.
Conclusion
The AutoML-MLOps platform offers a robust, scalable solution for users to create, deploy, and monitor ML models seamlessly. With a focus on accessibility, efficiency, and community, this platform aims to simplify the ML workflow, reduce development time, and enable users of all experience levels to harness the power of AI-ML.
