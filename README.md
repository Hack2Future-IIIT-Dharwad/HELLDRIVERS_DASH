# AutoML-MLOps Platform

## Overview

Our AutoML-MLOps platform empowers users to build, train, and deploy AI-ML models effortlessly, eliminating the need for extensive coding. This user-centric platform features automated data preprocessing, model hyperparameter optimization, real-time performance tracking, and an integrated community for model sharing. Designed to simplify and streamline the end-to-end ML workflow, users can seamlessly scale and host models on our cloud infrastructure, accessing them via API.

## Key Features

1. **No-Code Model Creation**: Easily create ML models with zero coding through simple English prompts and an intuitive interface.
2. **Community-Driven Model Sharing**: Share models within a collaborative environment to enhance knowledge exchange and model reuse.
3. **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize models with automated hyperparameter tuning tailored to specific data and objectives.
4. **Scalable Model Deployment**: Models scale automatically based on demand, optimizing for both performance and cost.
5. **Real-Time Monitoring & Analytics**: Comprehensive monitoring and analytics provide actionable insights into model performance and resource usage.

## Platform Workflow

The platform comprises several modules for each stage of the ML lifecycle:

### 1. **User Website**
   - **AI-ML Model Creator**: Users can build models through a guided, no-code interface, selecting from pre-trained options or building from scratch.
   - **Community Access**: Users can explore shared models, connect with other creators, and access community-driven insights for learning and collaboration.
   - **Performance Metrics & Analysis**: An analytics dashboard with real-time metrics and visualizations helps users track and optimize model performance.

### 2. **Model Creator**
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Automated data cleansing and preprocessing ensure data readiness for training, including classification and transformation.
   - **Model Training & Hyperparameter Optimization**: Leveraging H2O.ai and MLflow, this module automates model tuning for peak efficiency and performance.
   - **MLflow Integration**: Model tracking and versioning with MLflow ensure reproducibility and detailed experiment records.

### 3. **Tracking & Monitoring**
   - **Prometheus & Grafana**: For real-time performance tracking, this integration offers visualized model metrics, health monitoring, and anomaly detection.
   - **Performance Dashboards**: Metrics on accuracy, latency, and resource utilization are displayed through intuitive charts and graphs.

### 4. **Community Platform**
   - **Model Sharing**: Users can publish models to a community repository, enabling easy access for reuse by others.
   - **Hugging Face Storage**: Models and data are securely stored, supporting easy access and organization.
   - **Netlify Deployment**: Hosted on Netlify, the community platform ensures fast, scalable, and reliable web hosting.

### 5. **Automation**
   - **Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)**: GoCD automates model building, testing, and updating, enhancing productivity and keeping models up-to-date.
   - **Model API Generation**: Post-training, models can be hosted on our platform or via a generated API, giving users flexibility and deployment control.

### 6. **AI-Assisted Model Building**
   - **LangChain & ONMeta**: AI helpers assist users in model-building by providing contextual guidance and documentation.
   - **LLM Documentation Support**: An LLM offers comprehensive documentation, including usage tips and troubleshooting guidance.
